Time Vault is a free Widget (originally created by [PogoPixels](http://pogopixels.com/download/Time-Vault_7.html)) that will help you keep track of the time you spend on any given task. Click the play button when you start and click it once again when you have finished.

The tasks are grouped by projects and can be viewed by clicking on the arrow button. If you make a mistake, you can edit or delete a task by right-clicking on it.

This Widget works without the need of any external offline or online tool.
